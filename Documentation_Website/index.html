								<p>The hassle-free food scale</p>
								<p>Everyone's cooking at home during the pandemic, but do we really know what we're eating? The Nutriscient smart food scale automatically tracks your ingredient usage as you cook. The data is uploaded to the cloud where it is analyzed and associated with your account. Nutrition breakdowns and extended-timeframe visualizations are then presented via a cross-platform app.
								Combining low-cost hardware with sensing algorithms tuned for speed and precision, Nutriscient provides a seamless and intuitive experience for chefs of all levels.

							<p align="left">More and more people are cooking at home now due to the pandemic. While it's easy to find nutrition facts for processed snacks and restaurant meals, which have both undergone thorough analysis, the same does not apply for food cooked at home. Thus, while we think we know what we're eating, how do the nutrients really add up? Are we inadvertently feeding ourselves and our families more calories, sugars, and fats than we should?
							<br/><br/>Whether you’re super into fitness or just a typical office worker trying to stay healthy, Nutriscient is a perfect match for you. We designed Nutriscient to be an almost invisible part of your cooking process. With a response time under one second, you can place your ingredients on the scale and take them off without a pause.</p>

									<h3>System Architecture Overview</h3>
								</header>
							</article>
							<p align="left">From the high level, first, there is an embedded system component that detects different objects and weighs them. To measure weight, we will be using a load cell. To identify different objects, we will use RFID sticker tags attached onto different things and a RFID reader writer to register and then recognize them. We will also be using an OLED screen to display information. All these components are connected onto a ESP8266 microcontroller, which interfaces with the sensors and cloud.</p>
                            
                            <p align="left">The cloud interconnects the user with the smart scale. A web server is built and deployed along with a database, which accepts and stores historical weight data, allows the user to set up through the app, and process data for visualization within the user app.</p>


                            <h3 align="left">Data Flow</h3>
                            <p align="left">We used Flask to implement the backend, which was hosted on an AWS EC2 instance. The backend connects the ESP8266 smart scale, the smartphone app, as well as the MongoDB databases together.</p>

                            <article class="item">

                            <p align="left">Once the ESP8266 obtains a new weight measurement, it sends the weight as well as the associated RFID to the Flask backend in the form of a POST request. The backend will record the weight reading, the RFID, and the timestamp in a dedicated database, under table scale-id. If the RFID has not been seen before, the backend will also mark it as unregistered and send a push notification to the app.</p>

									<h3>Data Flow Chart -- Getting Nutritional Value</h3>
								</header>
							</article>
                            
                            <p align="left">When the App is opened after the notification fires, it asks the backend for the unregistered RFID via a GET request. Then the App prompts the user to either scan the barcode on the item, or manually enter a name for the ingredient.If the user chooses to use barcode, gtinsearch API is used to determine the name of the ingredient associated with the barcode.</p>

                            <p align="left">After the ingredient name is determined, a search on an online nutritional value database -- Spoonacular is performed, and potential results on the database with nutritional value information are presented to the user with its picture, which the user selects, then the selection updated in the backend through a POST API call. The detailed nutritional information is then retrieved from the same API and stored into a dedicated database, linking the RFID with its nutritional value.</p>

                            <p align="left">When the user wants to take a look at the visualizations of their nutrition intake or grocery needs on the app, the app will send a GET request to the Flask backend. On this request, the backend will query the databases, perform cleaning, and calculations as needed, and respond to the app with the necessary data to present the user with the visualizations.</p>

                            <h3 align="left">Hardware -- Accurate Weight Measurement</h3>

							<p align="left">Initial measurements of the load cell using the HX711 PGA/ADC showed substantial noise. To counteract this, a number of filtering techniques such as outlier rejection and data error detection were employed. Using calibrated weights, it was found that the ideal sensor calibration curve is linear in nature (with amazing accuracy and precision!).</p>

							<article class="item">
								<a class="image fit"><img src="images/Calibration.png" alt="" /></a>
								<header>
									<h3>With basic taring and data smoothing, the filtered sensor measurements showed a surprisingly strong linear correlation (R²=1).</h3>
								</header>
							</article>

							<p align="left">However, it would be a hassle if you needed scientific tools and expert knowledge to calibrate the scale. Thus, we developed a guided calibration procedure which instructs the user to place coins on the scale. The system automatically detects when the user has completed the requested action and continues on to the next step. Our sensors used up all of the ESP8266's GPIO (actually, we needed one more than that and hacked together a solution). Thus, we came up with the solution of having the user "double tap" on the scale to enter calibration mode. After calibration, the results are stored to flash and automatically loaded the next time the scale powers on.</p>

									<h3>Upon next startup, the previous calibration data is loaded automatically. As shown, measurement is then accurate as expected.</h3>
								</header>
							</article>
							
							<p align="left">When you're cooking, you don't want to have to fiddle with buttons or options. Nutriscient combines an automatic object presence detection algorithm with an RFID reader to automatically realize when an ingredient is placed onto the scale, wait for it to settle (i.e., the user has let go of the object), and then notice when the ingredient is removed. The ingredient is also identified. The detection algorithm relies only on load cell measurements so that the RFID reader does not have to constantly waste power in scanning for tags.</p>

									<h3>Sample of the automatic detection procedure. State 0: no ingredient. State 1: ingredient placed. State 2: steady measurement obtained. Notice that the entire weighing process completes very rapidly.</h3>
								</header>
							</article>

							<p align="left">The results are extremely accurate and precise! Some sample measurements are shown below. Note that the order reflects the order in which the measurements were taken. The measurements were not done in a consistent increasing/decreasing order in order to ensure the absense of sensor hysteresis.</p>
